# Program 1 “Given number=7, write a program to test and display only
# even numbers.

number_1 = 7

    print("number_1 = {0} is odd".format(number_1))
else:
    print("number_1 = {0} is even".format(number_1))

# program2: “Given number1=8, number2=13, write a program to only
# display if the sum is less than 10.”

number1 = 8
number2 = 13

sumofnumbers = 0

sumofnumbers = number1 + number2

if sumofnumbers < 10:
    print("The sum of {0} and {1} is equal to {2} is greater than 10.".format(number1, number2, sumofnumbers))
else:

# Program 3 Given count_int = 57 , write a program that tests if the count is more than 45 and displays
# the count is above the recommended number.

count_int = 57

if count_int > 45:
    print("The count is above the recommended number.")

## Inceidental using the IF statement

apples = 6
bus = "yellow"
if apples == 0:
    print("Where are the apples?")
else:
    print("Did you know the buses are {}s?".format(bus))
