# tuple consist of number of values separated by commas. Tuples
# are enclosed in parantheses, while the list are enclosed in brackets

m = (14, 34, 56)

# Tuples also have property like indexing and slicing
i = 1

# Lists

# List consists of hetrogeneous values separated by commas enclosed [and] and start from index 0
# Unlike Tuples, lists are mutable and they can be changed  by removing or reassigning the exisiting vakues
